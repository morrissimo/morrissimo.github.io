        <h3>To build useful solutions with awesome people - and have fun doing it.</h3>
        <p>I am looking for an engineering management position that will allow me to combine
          my years of hands-on experience designing and building systems with my passion to
          help talented engineers become even better.

            <h3>Architect</h3>
            <p>I have a solid track record of helping users assemble workable requirements and
              managing the implementation process through to delivery. Whether building systems on government contract
              work for US military clients, internal department clients as a developer for an international retailer, or
              helping early-stage companies iterate their MVPs towards scaleable 2.0s, I have repeatedly
              demonstrated an ability to balance time, resources and requirements to produce solutions
              that work.</p>

            <h3>Developer</h3>
            <p>I believe that while elegance is one of the key hallmarks of truly awesome software, the
              perfect is all too often the enemy of the good. Software is never "done", so understanding
              how to get it "done enough" is a crucial concept. Python has been my go-to language for a long time,
              but I've worked with many languages over the years and am always on the lookout for an
              excuse to dive into a new one. Meeting the functional spec isn't enough - readbility and
              maintainability are first-class deliverables as well.</p>
